                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Wearing a mask that covers your mouth and nose can
                    prevent those who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others. Recent evidence suggests
                    that masks may even benefit the wearer, offering some level of protection against infections.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    (CDC) recommends that everyone age 2 years and
                    older wear masks in public settings and around people who don’t live in the same household—when
                    you can’t stay 6 feet apart from others.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize"> Masks should be made of two or more layers of
                    washable, breathable fabric and fit snugly on your
                    face. “A quick and easy test is to hold your mask up to the light. If light passes through, it’s
                    too thin,” Dr. Meyer says. “Masks only work when they cover the nose and mouth because that is
                    where infected droplets are expelled and because the virus infects people through the mucous
                    membranes in their nose and throat.”</p>

                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are within
                    6 feet of one another (about two arms’ length) for a prolonged period (at least 15 minutes). Virus
                    transmission can occur when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, which releases droplets
                    from the mouth or nose into the air.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">People can be asymptomatic and spread the virus
                    without
                    knowing that they are sick, which makes it especially important to remain 6 feet away from others,
                    whether you are inside or outside. Plus, the more people you interact with at a gathering and the
                    longer time you spend interacting with each, the higher your risk of becoming infected with the
                    virus by someone who has it.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize"> If you are attending an event or gathering of some
                    kind,
                    it’s also important to be aware of the level of community transmission. One method of estimating how
                    high the risk may be is referred to as R0</p>

                <h1 class="display-5 fw-bolder text-dark mb-2 " id="features">3. Keep washing your hands
                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">You should wash your hands for at least 20 seconds
                    and lather the back of your hands and scrub between all fingers, under all fingernails, and reach up
                    to the wrist, the CDC advises. After washing, dry them completely (with an air dryer or paper towel)
                    and avoid touching the sink, faucet, door handles, or other objects. If no soap is available, use a
                    hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content, and rub the sanitizer on your hands until they are
                    dry.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Though the CDC states that the primary way the
                    virus spreads is through close person-to-person contact, it may be possible to become infected with
                    COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your own mouth,
                    nose, or eyes.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize"> Therefore, you should also wash your hands after
                    touching anything that may have been contaminated—such as a banister or door handle in a public
                    place—and before you touch your face.</p>

                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Fall and winter also bring holidays, when many
                    families get together. This can be especially tricky for those of us who live in parts of the
                    country where it will no longer be easy to gather outside. “After months apart during this pandemic,
                    families may be less willing to do a group Zoom call,” says Dr. Meyer. “This may be a year where we
                    need to get creative and rethink how to celebrate together.” </p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">That may simply mean more planning for the
                    holidays, Dr. Meyer says. “Consider quarantining for 14 days prior to the event and/or having
                    everyone get tested for COVID-19 if tests are available in your community,” she suggests. “If
                    possible, limit gatherings to as few people as possible—perhaps just immediate family and close
                    friends. When it is not possible to be outside, encourage your guests to wear masks indoors.
                    Consider spreading out food and eating areas so people are distanced while eating with their masks
                    down.”</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize"> Remember that your elderly family members and
                    those with other medical conditions are most vulnerable to COVID-19, so take extra measures to
                    protect them, says Dr. Meyer.</p>

                <h1 class="display-5 fw-bolder text-dark mb-2 " id="features">5. Dine out carefully
                </h1>Although many restaurants offer outdoor dining, which experts say is the safer option, a recent CDC
                study showed that adults with COVID-19 infections were twice as likely to have visited a restaurant in
                the two weeks preceding their illness than those without an infection. </p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">The study did not distinguish between indoor or
                    outdoor dining, or consider adherence to social distancing and mask use. (Those with COVID-19
                    infections were more likely to report having dined out at places where few other people were wearing
                    masks or socially distancing.)</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">“If you are meeting with others at a restaurant and
                    sharing tables while eating, which does not allow for appropriate social distancing and mask use, it
                    provides opportunities for the virus to spread from person to person,” Dr. Ogbuagu notes. “The
                    probability of spreading infection is higher with each additional person you are in contact with,
                    especially when people congregate.”</p>

                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">While you should avoid traveling if you can—as the
                    CDC says staying home is the best way to avoid COVID-19—sometimes, it is necessary. But before you
                    leave, you can check to see if the virus is spreading at your destination. More cases at your
                    destination increases your risk of contracting the virus and spreading it to others. You can view
                    each state’s weekly number of cases here on the CDC web site. </p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">“Also, don’t forget to check the regulations for
                    quarantining or testing at your destination or for when you return home,” says Dr. Meyer. Whether
                    you are traveling by car, plane, bus, or train, there are precautions you can take along the way.
                    The CDC has a detailed list of recommendations for each mode of transportation that mostly follows
                    the advice listed above of practicing social distancing, wearing a mask, and washing hands, but also
                    includes specific advice for various scenarios.</p>

                </h1>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Health officials are concerned about an influx of
                    flu and COVID-19 cases overwhelming hospitals. In the 2018-2019 flu season, 490,600 Americans were
                    hospitalized for the flu, according to the CDC.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Public health experts say this is not the year to
                    skip the flu vaccine. While measures to prevent COVID-19, including mask-wearing, washing hands, and
                    social distancing, can also protect against the flu, the vaccine is especially important—and safe,
                    doctors say.</p>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Though many people claim that the flu shot “gave
                    them the flu,” it is not possible to get infected with the influenza virus from the vaccine itself,
                    Dr. Meyer says. “The vaccine is made up of inactivated virus and is designed to ‘tickle’ the immune
                    system to respond to the real thing when it sees it,” she explains. “The most common side effect
                    from the flu shot is soreness or redness at the site of the injection, which resolves within a day
                    or two.”</p>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6
                    months old and up. Talk to your doctor about finding a vaccine near you.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">You should continue to seek any routine or
                    emergency medical care or treatments you need. Many health centers and doctors are offering
                    telehealth appointments (via video or phone) and most have protocols to minimize risk of exposure to
                    the coronavirus.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">Getting emergency care when you need it is
                    especially important. Earlier in the pandemic, pediatric and adult physicians reported fewer
                    emergency department visits, leading to a concern that patients were avoiding seeking care due to
                    fears of contracting COVID-19.</p>
                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">“As important as it is to continue to engage in
                    care for known medical issues, there is also a concern that people are falling behind on their
                    preventive healthcare, like getting routine procedures including colonoscopies and pap smears, as
                    well as vaccines,” Dr. Meyer says. “Those other health issues don’t go away just because there is a
                    pandemic. Reach out to your primary care doctor if you’re unsure what you are due to receive.”</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">It is likely that COVID-19 will be with us for a
                    while. “But with good efforts to continue to follow the public health measures to protect each
                    other, and, hopefully, a successful vaccine in the future, there is a light at the end of the
                    tunnel,” Dr. Ogbuagu says.</p>

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-dark-50 mb-4 fontSize">But even before a safe and effective vaccine is
                    available, COVID-19 is a preventable disease, Dr. Meyer points out. “It just requires all of us to
                    do the hard work of practicing the behaviors—described above—to keep our communities safe and
                    healthy.”</p>
